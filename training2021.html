              Learn the basics, from how to install, configure, and develop applications using RabbitMQ. Our course has plenty of examples to draw inspiration from.
              We’ll illustrate techniques and approaches that will help with setting the right foundations for new projects as well as taking existing projects to the next level. With your needs in mind we will venture into more advanced topics including clustering, high availability, plugins, performance and security, giving a full understanding of RabbitMQ capabilities in these areas. This course includes a hands-on project where a full system is built, using RabbitMQ as the messaging bus, with all concepts learnt during the training being put into practice.
