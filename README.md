# RabbitMQ Summit

This is the repo for the public website of http://rabbitmqsummit.com

The website is built in a Ruby based web site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It comes with a simple web server and file watchers that you can run locally. Once you make any changes it will automatically generate a new static version of the website placed in `_site/`. What's so great about Jekyll is that [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) supports it, meaning you can host the page for free - right here on GitHub.

To run locally:

    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve
