    This talk will introduce you to two a new RabbitMQ projects: cluster operator and messaging topology operator, which are kubernetes operators developed by the RabbitMQ team to help you deploy and use RabbitMQ on kubernetes.
    The talk will cover the basis of how to configure, deploy, and automate your RabbitMQ deployments using these operators and a demo.
    After this talk, you should be able to create and operate your own RabbitMQ clusters on any kubernetes cluster.

    3 years ago, the company I work for decided to start again, from scratch. Instead of on-prem softwares, we started to develop dozens of cloud based microservices communicating with each other AND on-prem cutting equipments.
    And which tool better to do this than RabbitMQ? But of course, deploying highly available message brokers in a cloud based environment with no prior experience has brought its share of surprises.
    In this talk, I'll share with you some of the rooky mistakes that we may or may not have made ;-)

    Great E2E tests have realistic, unique data, but when a test depends on multiple systems’ databases for its data, this becomes challenging. Sure, you can use a script to insert data into each separate system’s DB. But great E2E tests take advantage of RabbitMQ messaging to get data in place in the same way that would occur in production. This talk covers architecting E2E tests to use implicit waits, to adapt to an event-driven RabbitMQ world!  With tests like these, unforeseen, deployment-halting bugs can be found, and you can have confidence in the natural flow of data into your systems under test!

    In the past year and a half, we've built here at Vonage, a complex notification system based on RabbitMQ which is used today for most of the notifications our services send to our client side applications. We would like to share our story in which we - Designed a system architecture with a complex sharding solution & low to zero downtime, faced many issues with the way we used RabbitMQ and creative solutions we found to surpass our issues, and provided a flexible notification infrastructure.

  title: "RabbitMQ has a problem. Let us tell you about it."
  speaker: David Ansari
  role: Software Engineer
  company: VMware
  abstract: >-
    RabbitMQ exposes a wealth of metrics, logs, and events, and has decent dashboards. However, we know that users only look at dashboards when there is a problem.
    Wouldn't it be great if RabbitMQ notified you when there is a problem in the making? How about a run book on how to fix that specific problem? Imagine if some problems could even be fixed automatically.
    Let us show you what we have so far, and the direction that we are going towards.
