  title: "How to Safely and Reliably Upgrade Your RabbitMQ Cluster While Maintaining 100% Uptime"
  speaker: Stefan	Moser
  role: Principal Engineer
  company: AWS, Amazon MQ
  abstract:
    The RabbitMQ team releases new features, bug fixes and security patches at a blistering pace, but *you* have to upgrade your cluster to take advantage of all the awesome new value. Upgrading a RabbitMQ cluster can be a harrowing adventure full of pitfalls and danger lurking around every corner. But fear not, you are not alone! Based on the experience of keeping a large fleet of RabbitMQ clusters up-to-date and running the latest version of RabbitMQ, we’ll walk through all of the steps that you can take to safely, reliably and triumphantly upgrade your RabbitMQ cluster, all while maintaining 100% uptime!

  abstract:
    Quorum Queues were release in RabbitMQ 3.8 in October 2019 and in 3.10 received a whole bunch of requested features such as message TTL and at-least-once dead lettering.

    This session will look back at the history of Quorum Queue development and look at the various design decisions that were taken and discuss what worked and what didn't and what the future may look like.

    Learn how Bloomberg's Order Management Systems (OMS) leverage RabbitMQ! We'll talk about how we use RabbitMQ for OMS applications. As you can imagine, these systems require particularly complex topologies in order to satisfy critical service-level requirements related to performance, reliability, scalability, and client isolation.

    The evolution of our OMS topologies posed some common problems. As these systems grew and evolved, virtual hosts became bloated. Workflows that started as simple publisher/consumer pipelines required more steps inserted. Connection strings needed to be changed to adopt amqpprox – a proxy for the RabbitMQ brokers.

    To solve these and other challenges, we needed a system that could easily coordinate changes to the way large numbers of applications use RabbitMQ. We will share how we did this by developing a configuration system that drives our applications’ interactions with the broker, while maintaining the flexibility of a loosely-coupled system.

    An ideal message broker allows for high throughput and low latency while keeping hardware resource usage as low as possible.
    This talk presents tooling that helps improve RabbitMQ performance. We provide examples of how we spotted and fixed bottlenecks in the RabbitMQ broker. We show how you can leverage these tools to profile and further optimise the broker given your specific application workload.
