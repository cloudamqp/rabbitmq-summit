  title: "How to Safely and Reliably Upgrade Your RabbitMQ Cluster While Maintaining 100% Uptime"
  speaker: Stefan	Moser
  role: Principal Engineer
  company: AWS, Amazon MQ
  abstract:
    The RabbitMQ team releases new features, bug fixes and security patches at a blistering pace, but *you* have to upgrade your cluster to take advantage of all the awesome new value. Upgrading a RabbitMQ cluster can be a harrowing adventure full of pitfalls and danger lurking around every corner. But fear not, you are not alone! Based on the experience of keeping a large fleet of RabbitMQ clusters up-to-date and running the latest version of RabbitMQ, we’ll walk through all of the steps that you can take to safely, reliably and triumphantly upgrade your RabbitMQ cluster, all while maintaining 100% uptime!

  speaker: Karl	Nilsson
  role: RabbitMQ core team member
  company: VMware
  abstract:
    Quorum Queues were release in RabbitMQ 3.8 in October 2019 and in 3.10 received a whole bunch of requested features such as message TTL and at-least-once dead lettering.

    This session will look back at the history of Quorum Queue development and look at the various design decisions that were taken and discuss what worked and what didn't and what the future may look like.

    Learn how Bloomberg's Order Management Systems (OMS) leverage RabbitMQ! We'll talk about how we use RabbitMQ for OMS applications. As you can imagine, these systems require particularly complex topologies in order to satisfy critical service-level requirements related to performance, reliability, scalability, and client isolation.

    The evolution of our OMS topologies posed some common problems. As these systems grew and evolved, virtual hosts became bloated. Workflows that started as simple publisher/consumer pipelines required more steps inserted. Connection strings needed to be changed to adopt amqpprox – a proxy for the RabbitMQ brokers.

    To solve these and other challenges, we needed a system that could easily coordinate changes to the way large numbers of applications use RabbitMQ. We will share how we did this by developing a configuration system that drives our applications’ interactions with the broker, while maintaining the flexibility of a loosely-coupled system.

  title: "RabbitMQ Performance Improvements"
  speaker: David Ansari
  role: Software Engineer
  company: VMware
  abstract: >-
    An ideal message broker allows for high throughput and low latency while keeping hardware resource usage as low as possible.
    This talk presents tooling that helps improve RabbitMQ performance. We provide examples of how we spotted and fixed bottlenecks in the RabbitMQ broker. We show how you can leverage these tools to profile and further optimise the broker given your specific application workload.

  speaker: Gabor Olah
  role: RabbitMQ Consultant
  company: Erlang Solutions
  abstract: >-
    One of the most frequent questions I’m asked about RabbitMQ is whether it can do a specific throughput. My answer is almost always is that it depends. In this talk I will explain what affects RabbitMQ performance through practical examples. I will give a practical introduction to how to use PerfTest, the “official” performance testing tool for RabbitMQ to simulate different workloads over different topologies.

  speaker: Lovisa Johansson
  role: CMO
  company: 84codes
  abstract: >-
    We as human beings have always sought ways to communicate, even when there have been distances between us. The same need exists in the computer world - a method to send, receive, and create the message itself. Despite that, I often get the question; “Where would a message queue fit in my architecture?” Get ready for an answer to that question from the lens of common RabbitMQ use cases that are understandable no matter where you are or what language you’re speaking.

  title: "Write fast, reliable, and secure clients!"
  speaker: Carl Hörberg
  role: CEO
  company: 84codes
  abstract: >-
    The RabbitMQ website has over 70 clients listed, so there is naturally a vast array of client libraries. Among these, there are several great, unofficial clients developed by the RabbitMQ community, so what could go wrong? As we aim to deliver the best possible clients, we need to be sure to keep everything above-board and high quality. Carl Hörberg (CloudAMQP) has contributed to several client libraries lately, including the amqp-client for Crystal, the TypeScript client both for Node.js and browsers (using WebSocket), and the amqp-client for Ruby, where the new Ruby client is more than 4 times faster than other Ruby clients.

    In this presentation, Carl talks about how to write fast clients that are also reliable and secure. He also tells you why he decided to write some new libraries.

  speaker: Johan Rhodin
  role: CCO
  company: 84codes
  abstract: >-
    Depending on a certain number of factors, the job of a support engineer for CloudAMQP may vary. Every now and then RabbitMQ stops, and Johan has to work quickly to get it up and running, and after that, he needs to make bug reports, sometimes build features around it, and educate other customers.

    In this talk, Johan will walk you through the most common issues, and how he troubleshoots them, and he will share knowledge gained from mistakes made by us, customers, and the community through his own experience.

  speaker: Arnaud Cogoluègnes
  role: Software engineer, RabbitMQ team
  company: VMware
  abstract: >-
    RabbitMQ 3.9 introduced streams, a new log-type data structure. What is the state of RabbitMQ Streams after one year of existence? Feedback from users helped stabilize and optimize it. The ecosystem grew with new client libraries in several programming languages. But streams are far from feature-complete: super streams, to scale out publishing and consuming, and single active consumer, to handle consumer concurrency, are the two major features coming up.
    Join this session to find out about the present and future of RabbitMQ Streams!

    Khepri, RabbitMQ's next generation schema database, has evolved significantly from the last time it was covered at RabbitMQ Summit. So has RabbitMQ core team's understanding of where it can be adopted before RabbitMQ 4.0.

    In this talk we will cover the continued evolution of Khepri, what it has to offer to RabbitMQ users, and how soon they can expect Khepri to ship in a GA release.
