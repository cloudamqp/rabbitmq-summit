    RabbitMQ exposes a wealth of metrics, logs, and events, and has decent dashboards. However, we know that users only look at dashboards when there is a problem.
    Wouldn't it be great if RabbitMQ notified you when there is a problem in the making? How about a run book on how to fix that specific problem? Imagine if some problems could even be fixed automatically.
    Let us show you what we have so far, and the direction that we are going towards.

    And which tool better to do this than RabbitMQ? But of course, deploying highly available message brokers in a cloud based environment with no prior experience has brought its share of surprises.
    In this talk, I'll share with you some of the rooky mistakes that we may or may not have made ;-)
