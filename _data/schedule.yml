  title: 'Keynote: Idiomatic RabbitMQ'
  speaker: Gavin Roy
  abstract: >-
    In this talk Gavin will cover AMQP in the context of its use in RabbitMQ
    with a premise that if you don't fully understand AMQP, you don't understand
    RabbitMQ. Gavin will discuss the by-directional RPC behavior, connections,
    channels, objects, methods, and properties.

  title: Real life RabbitMQ on steroids
  speaker: Monish Unni
  abstract: >-
    Going from monoliths to distributed systems with RabbitMQ as a core
    component for online transaction processing. RabbitMQ has powerful
    abstractions that help you get up and running quickly. The talk will focus
    on the importance of understanding RabbitMQ's abstractions deeply to make
    them work for you in a distributed world. The talk will cover setting up
    RabbitMQ as a service broker and using it in a CI/CD pipeline for near zero
    developer effort.

  title: Developing RabbitMQ plugins in Elixir
  speaker: Matteo Cafasso
  abstract: >-
    Elixir is a rather new programming language fully compatible with the Erlang
    Virtual Machine. Due to its growing popularity, the RabbitMQ core team has
    recently decided to evaluate it in the next generation CLI-tools. Matteo has
    developed a RabbitMQ plugin without prior knowledge of RabbitMQ internals or
    the Erlang and Elixir languages. Elixir is an interesting language and to
    adopt it in RabbitMQ a few gaps need to be filled. The presentation
    discusses the challenges faced when developing RabbitMQ plugins in new
    languages and the ways to facilitate such processes.

    Come and join me in exploring what it looks like to succeed with RabbitMQ in
    production. We will cover 3 different enterprise messaging implementations
    that rely on RabbitMQ for:
  topic1: Financial trading
  topic2: Vehicle telemetry
  topic3: Monitoring of medical equipment

  title: A Walk Through the Design and Architecture of RabbitMQ
  speaker: Ayanda Dube
  abstract: >-
    As the use of RabbitMQ grows, there's a growing need for its operators and
    engineers to have a good understanding and appreciation of its internal
    design, and how its sub-components interact to meet the various messaging
    requirements in industry. In this talk I walk through the internal design of
    RabbitMQ, explaining some of the key components which attribute to its
    robustness and reputation of being a world leading and well trusted
    messaging system.
