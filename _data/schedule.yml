  title: 'Keynote: Idiomatic RabbitMQ'
  speaker: Gavin Roy
  abstract: >-
    In this talk Gavin will cover AMQP in the context of its use in RabbitMQ
    with a premise that if you don't fully understand AMQP, you don't understand
    RabbitMQ. Gavin will discuss the by-directional RPC behavior, connections,
    channels, objects, methods, and properties.

  title: Real life RabbitMQ on steroids
  speaker: Monish Unni
  abstract: >-
    Going from monoliths to distributed systems with RabbitMQ as a core
    component for online transaction processing. RabbitMQ has powerful
    abstractions that help you get up and running quickly. The talk will focus
    on the importance of understanding RabbitMQ's abstractions deeply to make
    them work for you in a distributed world. The talk will cover setting up
    RabbitMQ as a service broker and using it in a CI/CD pipeline for near zero
    developer effort.

  title: Developing RabbitMQ plugins in Elixir
  speaker: Matteo Cafasso
  abstract: >-
    RabbitMQ comprises of a state of the art plugin architecture, allowing it to
    be highly customizable and extensible to meet various requirements which may
    not be supported by an "out-of-the-box" broker installation. This
    presentation gives an overview of RabbitMQ's plugin infrastructure and
    discusses some useful, existing plugins with an overview of developing
    custom RabbitMQ plugins in Elixir. With Elixir being a language fully
    compatible with the Erlang Virtual Machine and growing in popularity, the
    RabbitMQ core team also adopted it in developing the next generation
    CLI-tools found in the latest release series, 3.7.x; a strong indication on
    the direction and future of RabbitMQ's product development. Outcome of this
    presentation looks to encourage more RabbitMQ plugin development in Elixir
    from the community!

  speaker: Gerhard Lazu
  abstract: >-
    Come and join me in exploring what it looks like to succeed with RabbitMQ in
    production. We will cover 3 different enterprise messaging implementations
    that rely on RabbitMQ for:
  topic1: Financial trading
  topic2: Vehicle telemetry
  topic3: Monitoring of medical equipment

  title: A Walk Through the Design and Architecture of RabbitMQ
  speaker: Ayanda Dube
  abstract: >-
    As the use of RabbitMQ grows, there's a growing need for its operators and
    engineers to have a good understanding and appreciation of its internal
    design, and how its sub-components interact to meet the various messaging
    requirements in industry. In this talk I walk through the internal design of
    RabbitMQ, explaining some of the key components which attribute to its
    robustness and reputation of being a world leading and well trusted
    messaging system.

  title: What it's like to bet your entire startup on Rabbit
  speaker: Nathan Herald
  abstract: >-
    Wunderlist made big bets on two technologies: AWS and rabbit. I will give an
    overview of what it’s like to live with rabbit for years, the tools and
    practices we built up around rabbit, and as many tips and learnings as I
    can.<br/><br/> In this talk you'll see real world data, hear anecdotes from
    using RabbitMQ at various scales. You should feel more comfortable making a
    bet on RabbitMQ as a critical part of your infrastructure after my
    presentation.

  title: What we've learned from running thousands of production RabbitMQ clusters
  speaker: Carl Hörberg
  abstract: >-
    Since 2012 CloudAMQP has been running dedicated and shared RabbitMQ clusters
    for customers around the world, in seven different clouds. In this talk Carl
    will address the most common misconception, misconfigurations and
    anti-patterns in RabbitMQ usage, and how they can be avoided. Carl will also
    present tools and methodologies to increase RabbitMQ reliability and
    performance.

  title: 'Keynote: Scaling RabbitMQ @ Goldman Sachs'
  speaker: Jonathan Skrzypek
  abstract: >-
    Goldman Sachs leverages hundreds of applications communicating with each
    other. The Data Management and Distribution group provides messaging
    middleware services to the firm’s ecosystem. This talk will be about why and
    how we adopted RabbitMQ as a first class citizen in our messaging product
    portfolio. A significant proportion of application teams at Goldman Sachs
    was used to traditional guaranteed messaging systems, and as such, moving to
    RabbitMQ was and still is a paradigm shift in how applications interact with
    a messaging layer. We will touch on the challenges of delivering RabbitMQ as
    a service at enterprise scale, including but not limited to deployment
    model, monitoring and telemetry, achieving data consistency, developer
    awareness.
