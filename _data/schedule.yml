    RabbitMQ exposes a wealth of metrics, logs, and events, and has decent dashboards. However, we know that users only look at dashboards when there is a problem.
    Wouldn't it be great if RabbitMQ notified you when there is a problem in the making? How about a run book on how to fix that specific problem? Imagine if some problems could even be fixed automatically.
    Let us show you what we have so far, and the direction that we are going towards.
